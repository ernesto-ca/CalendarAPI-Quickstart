# --- READ ME FIRST ---

### First thing's first:

-   Create a project in Google Cloud Plataform, follow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project)
-   Then, create your [CREDENTIALS](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials) for your App
-   Download your credentials and now you can follow the [Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python)

**This project is a Quickstart app using an API from google, so, you have to authorize "Test Users" in the dashboard of the API**
**EVEN your email that you use in this project (if you want to use the same email for testing)**

#### For more documentation about methods of the API in python check [this site](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/calendar/v3/python/latest/index.html)

##### Postscript:

-   Double '#' in the script means that is a own comment
-   If you don't want to install all of the Quickstart in your computer, you can use PIPENV SHELL
